I'm still remember the very first time that we met at open hack and that crazy thing I had made there. Hope you recall that ðŸ˜‚ You are one of the coolest people that I ever met.
and Thank you so much, Anlee for all the works you put on hack camp 2020. Thank you for such an amazing event with a lot of memories. You have done a lot for hack club fam,  sending stickers, SOM hardware, onboarding new clubs and a lot and Thank you for that. I gotta say, you are just awesome.

Once again a very happy birthday wishes, enjoy!!`,
