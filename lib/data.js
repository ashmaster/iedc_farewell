    text: `Heyy chetta!! Back when we first met  you gave me a detailed idea of what Hack Club was and how it could help aspiring devs and encouraged me to start one (you took time off your schedule even while you were busy hosting the hackathon). Following your suggestion, we were able to help over 50+ students try their hand in building cool stuff. On your b'day, I just wanted to let you know about the impact you have created.
Thanks a Lot for your support!!
Happy Birthday!! :)`,
